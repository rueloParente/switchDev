# switchDev
This repository goal is to showcase my learning journey through the Software Development Specialization course - part of the SWitCH initiative by ISEP and Porto Tech Hub.

Will be exploring:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Building robust and maintainable software architectures.
    Web Development: Crafting dynamic and interactive web applications with Spring Boot and ReactJS.
    Agile Methodologies: Collaborating effectively using Scrum for fast-paced and adaptable development.
    Continuous Integration: Automating testing and deployment for seamless delivery.

Embrace Industry-Standard Tools:

    Java: The foundation for versatile backend development.
    JavaScript: Unleashing frontend interactivity with ReactJS.
    JPA & Spring Boot: Simplifying database interactions and backend logic.
    Jenkins & Docker: Automating CI/CD for streamlined release pipelines.
    SQL: Mastering data management and retrieval.

Expect to find:

    Iterative & Incremental Projects: Deepening knowledge through hands-on tasks.
    Project-Based Learning (PBL): Solving real-world challenges, individually and collaboratively.
    Computer Systems & Networks: Exploring communication protocols and network fundamentals.
    Software Development: Building your OOP skills through algorithms and practical exercises.

Dive into my code, explore my journey!
